  Padding is the space thats inside the element between the content and the border and goes around all four sides of the content, Border is the space between the padding and the margin same as padding goes around all four sides of the content, Margin is the space between the border and the next content, that space outside the border  is called margin.


- What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Learned about Relative, Absolute ,Static and Fixed position,.
Learned how an element is positioned on a page and usually it doesn't appear within the normal flow and thats why i we use it together in conjunction with the box offset properties the -bottom, left,right and top, they really helped me to position the wanted element .
- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Changing colors, font-size,font-style, font-family etc they were the easiest. Positioning was the hardest for sure, i mean i took me 1 hour to get the footer at the end of the page.
- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
 Pretty much that all the styling is in Css,i learned about how to get from the backround color changed to position the footer stick to the bottom of the page !There is such a beauty in Css so many things that you can do, and yet i am at the very beginning and still trying to get used to margin, padding and border properties and which value shoud they take , but takes a lot of practice they say !
