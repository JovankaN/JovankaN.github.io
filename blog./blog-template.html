    <h3>What are the benefits of version control</h3>
    <p>Version control- The most popular open source version control system that lives locally in your computer, it allows you to make changes locally ,this changes could be anything from changing a typo to adding a whole new page or file to existing ones .For programers it keeps track of the changes made on their code files, for poets keeps track of their poems etc.We can all work on the same file without overwriting it, or deleting somebody's hard work, we can also go back and view our code, sent copy of it,pretty much it does saves a lot of snapshots of your project in the stages on its way of making it to a working and valuable code file and you will always be able to go back and see those snapshots , add more or maybe you want to go back and reuse it for another project that you might be working on , etc.So pretty much version control saves all of the snapshots,and keep track of it untill you get rid of it :)!</p>

    <h3>How git helps you keep track of changes and why use Github to store your code</h3>
    <p>How git keeps track of changes ... -Git leaves locally in your computer and yes it is a version control system, all of the changes that you do to a code file you do them locally with Git. After some changes were made ,we add and commit those changes and git will keep copy of all the changes made to a code file and make sure it doesn't get lost, combine it with everyone else codes and add it to the project you'll be working on. It runs perfect and won't break any codes that you'll be working on and it will allow many developers to work on it at the same time without being all messed up. Developers use version control -Git for all the reasons that i mentioned above , it is the most popular one but also it is very straightforward to use and provides incredible speed! Why use Github to store your code... -Github lives remotely on the Internet ,so it is an online hub for Git repositories. Github is the most used Git hosting service, and it allows a hundreds of users sharing code and interacting . You can share your code remotely and collaborate on projects at the same time. Hub where it allows you to compare changes and it makes it easier for you to push and pull from collaborators. So pretty much whatever you worked locally on your computer on some code file lets say, you push those code files through git on Github, and they are live online! Thats why Github comes handy for all of the staff that you keep track of. All of those changes to see who made them ,when , what's been deleted or added locally through version control, Github helps you those things to appear online!</p>

<!--Reflect 2.7 Blog Setup Pairing Challenge

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Definitely more fun as you both put down your ideas and creation into one project, so i wanna say much more sucessfull!
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Apsolutelly ,it is like you have guidance, some kind of direction in what you do, or plan to do, so it is very helpfull .
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Mainly keep it simple for now, and include information just enough for that particular page.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
A lot more and there are way much more to learn..:)), pretty exciting tho.
