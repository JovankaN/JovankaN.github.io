    <blockquote>"The Struggle you're in today is developing the Strenght you need tomorrow"</blockquote>
  <img src="imgs/joki-n.jpg" alt="" height="250"/>    <p>Hi, i am Jovanka Nikolovski, currently a Devbootcamp student in Chicago IL ,moved from Las Vegas NV, where i lived for about 7 years and worked in food and beverage industy.Doing what i did had a chance to meet and work for a different celebrity shefs which led to a lot of fun and great expercience. After i outgrew that lifestyle i was trying to switch careers and because i was always interested in IT, i got in touch with a dear friends of mine( who are a software developers as well), to introduce me and help me to engage more into these waters and somehow my eyes sparked and open wide to the power of technology. I think i totally found out i could do this, i loved what i worked on, and study so i could get ready for the interview to get accepted at DBC. So here i am still a student at DBC with a hope that one day i'll make a creative full stack software developer, and this page will include many more projects that i hopefully am going to work on!</p>
